        <p>Extensively modernised with top-of-the range fixtures and fittings throughout 2021 and furnished to
          the very highest standards at the beginning of 2022 to provide a sumptuous Art Deco feel, Villa
          Nuage is available for the first time this year as a luxury holiday villa, one which occupies an enviable
          position on the Côte d&#39;Azur on the outskirts of Monaco. With 800 square metres of accommodation
          (8,800 square feet) this beautifully finished four-bedroom holiday villa can comfortably
          accommodate up to 11 people, while there is an additional and delightful 30-square-metre guest
          house for two additional people or an au pair/nanny.</p>

          across Monte Carlo. Each bedroom opens out onto a south-facing terrace above which are individual
          electrically operated awnings to provide welcome shade on the hottest of summer days. In addition,
          each bedroom has its own, private, luxurious en-suite shower room with Italian-style walk-in shower.
          Villa Nuage also comes fully automated with a ‘smart home system’ that control the curtains and
          shutters, underfloor heating (which is rarely needed), air conditioning, lights and multimedia, while
          there is also broadband internet connection.</p>

          The delightful gardens with manicured lawns, shrubberies and a wide variety of mature trees provide
          quiet corners where the verdant canopy of foliage provides welcome and natural shade, as well as
          providing a delightful walk late in the evening as the sun sets.
          There is ample parking within the grounds, while there is also a spacious six-car garage.</p>

        <p><strong>Formerly a private home, today, Villa Nuage occupies a hillside plot of approximately 3,870 square
          metres (just under an acre) of professionally landscaped grounds at the end of a private access road
          in Roquebrune, on the doorstep of the Principality of Monaco. The location is perfect for a private
          villa if you want to enjoy the vibrancy of the iconic town of Monte Carlo, which is less than ten
          minutes by car to the very centre, sea front and beaches, yet wish to retreat at times to somewhere
          more tranquil and peaceful to relax by the pool and enjoy the glorious sunshine of an enviable
          Mediterranean climate.</strong></p>
          </div>
          <div class="col px-5">
            <p>Just two kilometres and well out of earshot from the property is the A8 autoroute which gives easy
              access to the Italian border which is less than 12km distant to the east. The major city of Nice is 25km
              to the west, and the international Nice Côte d&#39;Azur Airport 35km distant. If you have friends coming
              by train to visit, the nearest railway station is in the heart of Monte Carlo.</p>

      <div class="row px-5  row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2">
        <div class="col px-5">
        <p><strong>While the A8 gives you rapid access to much of the Côte d&#39;Azur, it also gives you access to multiple
          minor roads that lead inland, away from the coast, to small towns and villages that will treat you to a
          more traditional form of French culture and which are well worth exploring. Villa Nuage’s location is
          ideal as you do not have to negotiate the busy streets of Monte Carlo whenever you want to go
          anywhere.</strong></p>

            <p>For those of you who would enjoy a morning stroll down to a French or, to be more accurate,
              Monegasque café to enjoy a strong, dark ‘tasse de café’ and croissant or (irresistible) pain au
              chocolat, there is a shortcut into the town from the property down narrow lanes which takes less
              than fifteen minutes to walk as it is all very much downhill.</p>

          <p>The principal reception rooms and bedrooms occupy two floors of Villa Nuage, taking full advantage
            of the stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea and nearby Monte Carlo through full-height picture
            windows and patio doors. Aside from the summer kitchen, most rooms have solid oak parquet
            flooring which adds to the overall warmth of character of the villa. Sumptuous furniture adorns each
            and every room, nodding its head to the nuance of Art Deco throughout. A clever combination of
            fabric- and leather-upholstered furniture accentuate a sense of opulence, bolstered by the stunning
            chandeliers and impressive light fittings throughout.</p>

                  At Villa Nuage we have tried to provide the ideal holiday retreat both for gathering socially, and also
providing privacy and tranquility, some personal space, when needed.
The large, richly furnished living room includes a 100-inch television and is flanked on the one side by
the mirrored-wall games room and on the other by the magnificent reception hall and spacious
dining room.
The formal dining room, with its in-keeping Art Deco-style fireplace, has an imposing mahogany table
which is set for 12, though there is additional seating and tabling to cater for up to 20 dinner guests.
The games room is furnished with both foosball and a pool table.
The magnificent, fully equipped kitchen also doubles up as a breakfast room or casual dining room
with a table which seats six, comfortably. The kitchen comes with everything you, or the chef, could
possibly need, and much more besides, including an essential coffee machine, wine cooler, and
multiple refrigerators.
In addition to the kitchen there is a second, summer kitchen and also a utility/laundry room with all
the necessary white goods.

                  All four bedrooms are generously furnished with king-size beds, each room having its own, individual
style. All bedrooms also have a shower room, which includes a Japanese Toto toilet and Italian-style
walk-in ‘rainwater’ shower. Bathrobes, towels, hairdryers and toiletries are all included.
The Master Bedroom includes an office, jacuzzi and sauna.

There is extensive walk-in wardrobe space and ample plush, soft furnishings, and in three of the four
bedrooms, should you have a surfeit of guests wanting to stay overnight, there is a discretely hidden
drop-down single bed that, when not in use, folds away discretely into one of the cupboards.
As with all the main reception rooms, each bedroom has a full-height patio door to take full
advantage of the spectacular view down to the sea and Monte Carlo. Whether it is the twinkling of
the night-time lights, or the rays of the early morning sun striking the water, the view is so exquisite
you are unlikely to ever want to draw the curtains!
All bedrooms are connected to Apple AirPlay, while two of the bedrooms have TVs connected to
Apple TV and Kartina TV.
Each bedroom has an individual wall-mounted safe.

        <h3>At Villa Nuage</h3>
        <p>
          From watching Apple TV or Kartina TV on a 100” screen or in the privacy of your
bedroom, to listening to your favourite music via Apple AirPlay on a Bang and Olufsen hi-fi system,
Villa Nuage is well equipped to meet your audio and visual needs. But the fun doesn’t stop there,
with a foosball table and pool table in the games room.
For those of you who have energy to burn, we also have a table tennis table and badminton
equipment to enjoy a game outside on patio or one of the green pastures.
To make your stay at Villa Nuage extra memorable, there is also an astronomical telescope for use up
on the roof terrace to enjoy a bit of stargazing on one of the many crystal-clear moonlit nights.

      <h3>Nighttime in Monaco</h3>
      <p>Who can resist the allure of the Casino de Monte Carlo, immortalised not
        once, but twice in James Bond films? Of course, there is so much more to Monte Carlo than a casino.
        Beyond the wonderful choice of restaurants, there is the Opéra Garnier Monte-Carlo which is
        attached to the Casino de Monte-Carlo. There is also the Grimaldi Forum, a popular venue for
        concerts, with Iggy Pop putting on a free show on May 19. The Theatre Princess Grace Monaco is a
        wonderful venue, while for something out of the ordinary, Le Fort Antoine dans le Ville is an open-air
        theatre which puts on productions throughout the summer months.
        If nightclubs are your scene, check out Blue Gin on the water’s edge which unbeatable views of the
        Mediterranean. La Rascasse is probably the most famous bend on the FI Monaco Grand Prix circuit,
        and it also happens to be the location of the top, eponymously named bar and nightclub. Jimmy’z is
        perhaps the most iconic nightclub in Monaco, and if you are a night owl, The Living Room doesn’t
        even open its doors before 11 p.m.!</p>

      <h3>Leisure at Villa Nuage</h3>
      <p>It is impossible to miss the sculptured 68-square-metre swimming pool occupying one corner of the
magnificent patio, the whole area designed for relaxing and soaking up the sun on one of the many
loungers provided, sitting in the shade under one of the parasols, or enjoying a barbecue together in
the evening when the heat from the sun becomes subdued.
For those of you who enjoy a daily workout, there is a fully equipped gymnasium with state-of-the-
art equipment providing you with all that you need for either a resistance or aerobic workout.
After your workout, why not unwind in the hammam (steam room) or enjoy some pampering in the
massage room with its professional-standard heated massage table.
If you speak nicely to those staying in the master bedroom, they may even let you share the sauna
and jacuzzi!</p>

          <h1>Eating Out</h1>
          <p>Did you know that in 2020 there were 628 Michelin-starred restaurants in France, of which 86 were
            located in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#39;Azur region, surrounding Monaco on all sides?
            The exciting news is that one of the very best restaurants in the country is located in Monte Carlo, Le
            Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l&#39;Hôtel de Paris , a three-star Michelin restaurant where chefs Dominique
            Lory and Alain Ducasse have created a modern and contemporary menu.
            There are six other Michelin-starred restaurants in Monaco, including Elsa, which specialises in
            Mediterranean cuisine, Yoshi, which is a Japanese restaurant, and La Table d’Antonio au Rampoldi,
            which delights with creative Italian cuisine. Maya Bay (Japanese and Thai), Song Qi (Asian and
            Chinese) and Beefbar (grilled meats) are all also mentioned in the Michelin Guide.
            If you want some insider knowledge regarding the best places to eat offering fresh local produce,
            have a quiet word with your executive chef!</p>

minutes to the east of Villa Nuage and is definitely worth visiting. There are some delightful walks
around the town, which then provide a great excuse for stopping for lunch at La Grotte &amp; L’Olivier or
